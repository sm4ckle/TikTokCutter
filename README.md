# TikTokCutter
Very simple script that utilizes FFMPEG to cut out the TikTok advertisment at the end of downloaded TikTok videos.

Must have ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as ttcut.py. You can download it by going here, then just extract ffmpeg.exe from the bin folder: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z
